# Progress towards my learning goals

## 2018

Goal for the year: is to acquire the skills to pivot my day job into __Data__

* Data Analytics at a minimum
* Jr. Data Science or Mid-level Data Engineering (using my SWE experience)
* Deep Learning Research (hopefully with [OpenAI to assist](https://blog.openai.com/openai-scholars/))

I've taken a few courses already, like Udacity's Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree (no longer recommend. Take [the updated course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101))
